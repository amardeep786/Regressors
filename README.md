This file contains code for Regressor which will help in predicting the per instance time of object detection [detectRegressor], instance segementation [predictRegressor] and speech-to-text [speechRegressor] conversion.
for detectRegressor and predictRegressor, we have divided results in bin of 5ms and each bin has its own results metrics.
AllCombination folder consists of code that have all combination of application that captures execution time of applications and capturing various system metrics.
