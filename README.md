- **CPU Usage** - Per-core utilization during multi-app execution
- **GPU Usage** - Graphics processing load analysis  
- **Application-wise RAM** - Memory consumption per application instance
- **System Performance** - Cross-application resource interference patterns

**Key Features:**
- Automated combination generation for workload testing
- Real-time system metric collection
- Resource contention analysis across applications

### ü§ñ **Individual_Regressor**
*Per-Instance Processing Time Prediction*

Machine learning regressors for predicting processing times across three domains:

| Regressor Type | Purpose | Binning Strategy |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| **detectRegressor** | Object detection time prediction | 5ms bins |
| **predictRegressor** | Instance segmentation time prediction | 5ms bins |
| **speechRegressor** | Speech-to-text conversion analysis | N/A |

**Performance Metrics:** MSE, R¬≤ scores with granular bin-level analysis

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Waiting_Time**
*Process Queue Analysis*

Contains code and datasets for analyzing **application waiting times** in the system ready queue:

- **Proc System Calls** - Direct kernel-level timing measurements
- **Queue Analysis** - Ready queue delay patterns by application type
- **Temporal Analysis** - Waiting time distributions and trends

**Data Sources:** Linux `/proc` filesystem integration for real-time process monitoring
