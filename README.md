AllCombination directory -> consists of code which produces all combination of all instances of 3 applications and record various system as well as application based key features like ram used,total ram , per instance processing time etc.


This file contains code for Regressor which will help in predicting the per instance time of object detection [detectRegressor], instance segementation [predictRegressor] and speech-to-text [speechRegressor] conversion.
for detectRegressor and predictRegressor, we have divided results in bin of 5ms and each bin has its own results metrics.

Waiting time directory consists of various applications running in parallely and we calculalted the waiting time of each application which further helpful in predicting waiting time for specific application.
